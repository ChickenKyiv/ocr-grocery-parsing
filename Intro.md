GS(GroceriStar - current project)
GL(grocery list)
At GS we have only one grocery list template for cloning. it's name Ultimate Grocery List but it have all items in one place. 
For a lot of cases - we don't need all this data. Usually people will need to delete a lot of items from personal lists.

So i think it'll be good feature to have another GL templates at GS.

Web is full with GL for different topics. Vegan, healthy, cheap, diabetic, etc.
