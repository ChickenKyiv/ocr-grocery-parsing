#### (Proposal) To Use Google Vision API for our image-to-text script
We tried quickly to use google vision, but right now i think it's better to finish this project with our
current tesseract library logic.
Google Vision is not free, but they have some startup based plans, maybe later we'll apply into it.


This data that Omkar(Our Lead) shared with me - it's showing a big promise for using google vision.
But in order to proceed further - I need to apply to google startups
