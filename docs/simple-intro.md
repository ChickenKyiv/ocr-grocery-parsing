Groceristar is a project that we're building. Briefly, it's a shopping list(grocery list management) app.
In the beginning, we have only one grocery list at our database - Ultimate Grocery List template.

it's a huge template as you can see. it has a big amount of data(this is why it's called an Ultimate).
But for most of our daily cases - we don't need all items from this list. While we have only one template in - users spend a lot of time.
They need to delete a lot of unnecessary items from their personal lists.

It is a good feature to have more templates that people can use at GroceriStar project.

Again, you can find a lot of grocery lists online.

We plan to add more specific templates oriented for different cases or categories. Grocery lists can be specific to vegan food, healthy habits, diabetics food - and it will be helpful to our users.

For the moment of publishing this article, we have 8-15 grocery list templates in our database. We converted data to JSON format and using this template at our projects.

When I made my research, I find at least 200 different grocery lists. I save URLs for some of them.
It'll be a very dumb idea to copy-paste this data into our database. It can be better done with Machine Learning algorithms.
So this is the main idea behind creating our image parsing script.
