so, what we have for this moment?
we actually completed it(as i was informed). so images converted into json or txt file that can be used.
1. i'm not sure if we tested it a lot. i mean we have some different types of images. you'll need to figure it out
2. our problem is - data that we have in output file is raw. so it's hard to read file -> convert it into js objects -> push to our database with our current structure.
in order to make this cycle clear - we unbind our server from our projects right now. because it's a bit hard to manage this whole process.
instead of testing ocr results, saved to our mongodb databse - we create a very simple separated plugin, that can be include into any small project and give anyone ability to read the data.



some parts separated between repositories
so it can be easily shared with different teams, like react frontend or ml team

 i think i put everything that i want:  https://github.com/GroceriStar/ocr-grocery-parsing/blob/master/explanation.md
