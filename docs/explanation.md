This is an end result that should be: https://github.com/GroceriStar/ocr-grocery-parsing/issues/2

- more details about how our `fetch` plugin structured: https://medium.com/groceristar/groceristar-fetch-small-module-that-weve-created-8b4a62bd5d7b
- repository: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch
- documentation: https://groceristar.github.io/groceristar-fetch/

- different grocery lists: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/tree/master/data/Grocery
- more lists: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/tree/master/data/Grocery/md


- Grocery.json file: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/blob/master/data/Grocery/grocery.json

- Departments.json file: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/blob/master/data/Departments/departments.json

- Ingredients.json file: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/blob/master/data/Ingredients/ingredients.json

- Measurements.json file: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/blob/master/data/Measurement/measurements.json

I'll think that we complete this assignment when I'll be able to easily grab JSON file with grocery lists - move it to our fetch plugin and import our data from that file into our server.


Note: In order to upload data that we parse, we should also store website link.
Because we need to add credits, image link, title.
